    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "A portfolio is a collection of financial instruments, such as stocks, bonds, cash, commodities, etc. Portfolio managers have one goal in mind: maximizing returns. Diversification (not putting all eggs in the same basket) is a key concept in portfolio management to reduce risks. It aims to maximize returns by investing in different areas that would each react differently to the same event. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most popular portfolio optimization model is the Marry Markowitz model (HM), which assists in the selection of the most efficient portfolio by analyzing various possible portfolios of the given securities. It basically means that we create N amount of portfolios, with different weights assigned to each asset, and the model should determine the set of most efficient portfolios (Efficient Frontier EF). \n",
    "The HM model is called the **mean-variance model** because it is based on expected returns (mean) and standard deviation (variance) of the various portfolios. \n",
    "\n",
    "A **mean-variance optimization (MVO)** problem can be formulated in two ways: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Maximizing return for a given risk\n",
    "* Minimizing risk for a given return\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have the portfolio efficient frontier, the investor still needs to select the portfolio he/she wants. The decision is based on a set of indifference curves, and we could rationally find the most optimal portfolio. We will provide further explanations during the analysis."

    "Consider different securities, with random returns. For each security, $i = 1,...,n$ estimates, we have **expected returns $\\mu_{i}$**, **variance $\\sigma_{i}^{2}$**, and **correlation coeffcient $\\rho_{ij}$** for securities $i$ and $j$.\n",
    "We can represent the proportion (weight) of the total funds invested in security $i$ by $x_i$. We can compute the expected return and the variance of the resulting portfolio $x = (x_1,...,x_n)$:\n",
    "* $E[x] = x_1 \\mu_{1} + ... + x_n \\mu_{n} = \\mu^T x$\n",
    "* $Var[x] = \\sum_{i,j} \\rho_{ij} \\sigma_{i} \\sigma_{j} x_i x_j = x^T Qx$ \\\n",
    "where $Q_{ij} = \\rho_{ij} \\sigma_{i} \\sigma_{j}$ and $\\mu = (\\mu_{1},...,\\mu_{n})$, and the portfolio vector $x$ must satisfy $\\sum_{i} x_i = 1$ \n",
    "\n",
    "A feasible portfolio $x$ is called **efficient** if it has (A) the minimum variance among all portfolios that have at least a certain expected return, OR, has (B) the maximal expected return among all portfolios with the same variance. The collection of all efficient portfolios generate the **efficient frontier**."
